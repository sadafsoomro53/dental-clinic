## Features

- **User Authentication:** JWT-based signup, login, and role-based access control (admin vs. user).
- **Appointment Management:** Create, read, update, and delete patient appointments.
- **Treatment Management:** CRUD operations for dental treatments offered by the clinic.
- **Protected Routes:** Middleware enforces authentication and authorization for sensitive endpoints.
- **Responsive Frontend:** React SPA consuming the Express API with client-side routing.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, React Router, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose  
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas  
- **Deployment:** Vercel (frontend & serverless backend)  

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=14.x)  
- npm or yarn  
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB)

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/aezal-dental-clinic.git
   cd aezal-dental-clinic
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   npm install

   # Frontend
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` folder with the following variables:

```ini
MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

For production (Vercel), add the same keys in your project settings under **Environment Variables**.

---

## Running Locally

1. **Start the backend server**  
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```
   The API will run at `http://localhost:5000`.

2. **Start the frontend**  
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```
   The React app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **Proxy setup**  
   The React dev server proxies `/api` requests to the backend via the `proxy` field in `frontend/package.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
   }
   ```

## Deployment

This project is configured to deploy both frontend and backend on Vercel:

1. **Frontend**: `@vercel/static-build` reads from `frontend/build` (or `frontend/dist` if you’re using Vite).  
2. **Backend**: `@vercel/node` serves your Express API under `/api/*`.  
3. **Routes** in `vercel.json`:
   - Proxy `/api/*` to the Express function  
   - Serve static files via Vercel’s CDN  
   - SPA fallback: `/.*` → `/index.html`
